# PROJECT : EXCURSION 

In this project, I will create a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion”. I will use my growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. I will be proud of myself when it all comes together!

The web page advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.


## Acknowledgement

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the trainers of Generation JFSD training program for helping me step in!
